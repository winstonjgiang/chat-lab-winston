# ChatBot-Lab

In this lab, you'll make a simple chatbot that plays a trivia game with the user!

Checkpoint 1 - Chatbot Lab installed/working, and when you send any message the chatbot responds with “I am da response!”
 * Clone the repo, then do `yarn`, then start expo with `yarn expo start`
 * You won't need to do any coding for this checkpoint. Just find the correct line of code to uncomment

Checkpoint 2 - Your first piece of simple chatbot logic works, so that when the user says “Yes” the chatbot asks a question, and if the user says anything else the chatbot politely tells the user to say “Yes” to start.

Checkpoint 3 - Your first trivia question is working, so the chatbot tells the user when they’ve answered the first question correctly and asks them a second question.

Checkpoint 4 - Your chatbot trivia game is working with three questions!

Checkpoint 5 (optional) - Add more questions to your chatbot with more interesting logic. Examples: 
 * Multi-character dialogue. For example, the first “riddle” is asked by a troll on a bridge, then you advance to the cave entrance where a witch asks you the second riddle (can you figure out how to respond as different users with GiftedChat?)
 * Randomly generated math problems (maybe the chatbot keeps score too)
 * Hangman (this is tricky! Printing the word with the correct letters showing/hidden is a challenging “leetcode-esque” string problem)
 * Use an API to get data for trivia (e.g. for a marvel movie quote API, “Which marvel character says this quote?”)
